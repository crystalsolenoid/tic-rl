# tic-rl
A roguelike engine developed in 2018 and 2019 in the TIC-80 with Lua. Has a custom line-of-sight algorithm, basic map generation, and great atmosphere.

I created this project back when I didn't know how to do version control in TIC-80 projects, so there are many versions. The version `mazeGen_feb_19_19_WORKS.tic` looks like the most mature that runs out of the box. The version `ghosts_backup.lua` should also work, but I think there's a compatibility problem with memory banks for code and newer versions of TIC-80, so it isn't running as-is.

I would love to revisit this code someday and re-understand it and make it more readable and documented, but for now I just want to preserve it ASAP!
